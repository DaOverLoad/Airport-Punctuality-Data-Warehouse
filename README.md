# Airport-Punctuality-Data-Warehouse
This project involves designing and building a full data warehouse system to analyse punctuality performance across UK airports.

Using 24 months of aviation punctuality data, I developed a star schema, performed ETL processing, built fact and dimension tables in Oracle SQL, and produced visual analytics in Tableau. The goal was to uncover trends in delays, cancellations, and airline performance through clean, structured data workflows.
